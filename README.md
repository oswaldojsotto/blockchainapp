-Installed Next JS v14 for development enviroment framework with typescript and
tailwind css support. Also has built in React-router to handle page routing.

-One of the requirements were to use Redux, in the case I used it, it wasn't
necessary but, I wanted to use it just in case

the case where is used is: when you connect your wallet, you also fetch the
current usd price of the Ethereum, and send the price of the ethereum with the
current ethereums in the wallet to the slice, then the slice calculates the
aprox value of the ethereum in usd dollars, and we show it in the balance of the
user.
